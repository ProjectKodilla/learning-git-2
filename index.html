	<h1>Prisoner in Paradise</h1>
		<h2>Sunrise Avenue</h2>
		<p>Your skin
Touching my skin in the morning ,
Smelling like sun on the water ,
What could be wrong with this ,

Air
Catching my breath isn't easy ,
Feels like you're breathing for me ,
Something is wrong with this ,

We're close
Maybe too close for comfort ,
And if I'm really honest ,
I'll never get used this ,

Oh
Wham am I fighting the angels ?
Where do they want to take me ?
Why is it so hard to fly ?

Oh 
What is so great about freedom ?
You never meant to make me ,
A prisoner in paradise ,
